# eForm - dataBase_Project
Group Project to make our first contact with the world of databases( and not to drown in the absurd ocean of requests pulled out by this university)

---------------- HOW TO RUN

The project required an Apache Module running on port 80, 443.

On our machines we created the MySQL connection on 127.0.0.1:3306.

To begin the uncanny and whimsical journey just open HOME.html.

For any further dubt consult the documentation file or,
for a more pleasent view, the presentation.
