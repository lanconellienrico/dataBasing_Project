# dataBasing_Project
Group Project to make our first contact with the world of databases( and not to drown in the absurd ocean of request pulled out by this university)

---------------- HOW TO RUN

The project required an Apache Module running on port 80, 443.

On our machines we created the MySQL connection on 127.0.0.1:3306.

To begin the uncanny and whimsical journey just open HOME.html.
